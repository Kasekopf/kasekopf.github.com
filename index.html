			Discrete integration is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence with numerous applications, including probabilistic reasoning, planning, inexact computing,
			engineering reliability, and statistical physics. The task is to count the total weight,
			subject to a given weight function, of all solutions to given constraints. Developing
			tools to compute the total weight for applied problems is an area of active research.
			<br>Over the last ten years, hundreds of thousands of research hours have been poured
			into low-level computational tools and compilers for neural network training and
			inference. Simultaneously, there has been a surge in high-level reasoning tools based
			on graph decompositions, spurred by several competitions. While some existing tools
			for discrete integration (counters) tightly integrate with these low-level computational
			or high-level reasoning tools, no existing counter is able to leverage both together.
			<br>In this dissertation, we demonstrate that a clean separation of high-level reasoning
			(planning) and low-level computation (execution) leads to scalable and more flexible
			counters. Instead of building tightly on any particular tool, we target APIs that
			can be fulfilled by multiple implementations. This requires novel theoretical and
			algorithmic techniques to use existing high-level reasoning tools in a way consistent
			with the options available in popular low-level computational libraries. The resulting
			counters perform well in many hardware settings (singlecore, multicore, GPU).

			Recent work in weighted model counting proposed a unifying framework for dynamic-programming algorithms. The core of this framework is a project-join tree: an execution  plan that specifies how Boolean variables are eliminated. We adapt this framework to compute exact literal-weighted projected model counts of propositional formulas in  conjunctive normal form. Our key conceptual contribution is to define gradedness on project-join trees, a novel condition requiring irrelevant variables to be eliminated before relevant variables. We prove that building graded project-join trees can be reduced to building standard project-join trees and that graded project-join trees can be used to compute projected model counts. The resulting tool ProCount is competitive with the state-of-the-art tools D4P, projMC, and reSSAT, achieving the shortest solving time on 131 benchmarks of 390 benchmarks solved by at least one tool, from 849 benchmarks in total.

			Discrete integration is a fundamental problem in computer science that concerns the computation of discrete sums over exponentially large sets. Despite intense interest from researchers for over three decades, the design of scalable techniques for computing estimates with rigorous guarantees for discrete integration remains the holy grail. The key contribution of this work addresses this scalability challenge via an efficient reduction of discrete integration to model counting. The proposed reduction is achieved via a significant increase in the dimensionality that, contrary to conventional wisdom, leads to solving an instance of the relatively simpler problem of model counting.<br>
			Building on the promising approach proposed by Chakraborty et al, our work overcomes the key weakness of their approach: a restriction to dyadic weights. We augment our proposed reduction, called DeWeight, with a state of the art efficient approximate model counter and perform detailed empirical analysis over benchmarks arising from neural network verification domains, an emerging application area of critical importance. DeWeight, to the best of our knowledge, is the first technique to compute estimates with provable guarantees for this class of benchmarks.

			We propose a unifying dynamic-programming framework to compute exact literal-weighted model counts of formulas in conjunctive normal form. At the center of our framework are project-join trees, which specify efficient project-join orders to apply additive projections (variable eliminations) and joins (clause multiplications). In this framework, model counting is performed in two phases. First, the planning phase constructs a project-join tree from a formula. Second, the execution phase computes the model count of the formula, employing dynamic programming as guided by the project-join tree. We empirically evaluate various methods for the planning phase and compare constraint-satisfaction heuristics with tree-decomposition tools. We also investigate the performance of different data structures for the execution phase and compare algebraic decision diagrams with tensors. We show that our dynamic-programming model-counting framework DPMC is competitive with the state-of-the-art exact weighted model counters cachet, c2d, d4, and miniC2D.

			A promising new algebraic approach to weighted model counting makes use of tensor networks, following a reduction from weighted model counting to tensor-network contraction. Prior work has focused on analyzing the single-core performance of this approach, and demonstrated that it is an effective addition to the current portfolio of weighted-model-counting algorithms.<br>
			In this work, we explore the impact of multi-core and GPU use on tensor-network contraction for weighted model counting. To leverage multiple cores, we implement a parallel portfolio of tree-decomposition solvers to find an order to contract tensors. To leverage a GPU, we use TensorFlow to perform the contractions. We compare the resulting weighted model counter on 1914 standard weighted model counting benchmarks and show that it significantly improves the virtual best solver.

	Boolean functions are characterized by the unique structure of their solution space. Some properties of the solution space, such as the possible existence of a solution, are well sought after but difficult to obtain. To better reason about such properties, we define transformations as functions that change one Boolean function to another while maintaining some properties of the solution space. We explore transformations of Boolean functions, compactly described as Boolean formulas, where the property is to maintain is the number of solutions in the solution spaces. We first discuss general characteristics of such transformations. Next, we reason about the computational complexity of transforming one Boolean formula to another. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of transformations by extensively discussing transformations of Boolean formulas to "blocks," which are solution spaces in which the set of solutions makes a prefix of the solution space under a lexicographic order of the variables.

			Constrained counting is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence. A promising new algebraic approach to constrained counting makes use of tensor networks, following a reduction from constrained counting to the problem of tensor-network contraction. Contracting a tensor network efficiently requires determining an efficient order to contract the tensors inside the network, which is itself a difficult problem.<br>
			In this work, we apply graph decompositions to find contraction orders for tensor networks. We prove that finding an efficient contraction order for a tensor network is equivalent to the well-known problem of finding an optimal carving decomposition. Thus memory-optimal contraction orders for planar tensor networks can be found in cubic time. We show that tree decompositions can be used both to find carving decompositions and to factor tensor networks with high-rank, structured tensors.<br>
			We implement these algorithms on top of state-of-the-art solvers for tree decompositions and show empirically that the resulting weighted model counter is quite effective and useful as part of a portfolio of counters.

	Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) is fundamental in many diverse areas such as artificial intelligence, formal verification, and biology. Recent universal-hashing based approaches to the problems of sampling and counting crucially depend on the runtime performance of specialized SAT solvers on formulas expressed as the conjunction of both k-CNF constraints and variable-width XOR constraints (known as CNF-XOR formulas), but random CNF-XOR formulas are unexplored in prior work. In this work, we present the first study of random CNF-XOR formulas. We prove that a phase-transition in the satisfiability of random CNF-XOR formulas exists for k=2 and (when the number of k-CNF constraints is small) for k>2. We empirically demonstrate that a state-of-the-art SAT solver scales exponentially on random CNF-XOR formulas across many clause densities, peaking around the empirical phase-transition location. Finally, we prove that the solution space of random CNF-XOR formulas 'shatters' at all nonzero XOR-clause densities into well-separated components.

	The runtime performance of modern SAT solvers on random k-CNF formulas is deeply connected with the `phase-transition&#39; phenomenon seen empirically in the satisfiability of random k-CNF formulas. Recent universal hashing-based approaches to sampling and counting crucially depend on the runtime performance of SAT solvers on formulas expressed as the conjunction of both k-CNF and XOR constraints (known as k-CNF-XOR formulas), but the behavior of random k-CNF-XOR formulas is unexplored in prior work. In this paper, we present the first study of the satisfiability of random k-CNF-XOR formulas. We show empirical evidence of a surprising phase-transition that follows a linear trade-off between k-CNF and XOR constraints. Furthermore, we prove that a phase-transition for k-CNF-XOR formulas exists for k = 2 and (when the number of k-CNF constraints is small) for k &gt; 2.
